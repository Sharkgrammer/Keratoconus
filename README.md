# Keratoconus 
Keratoconus is a progressive eye condition where the cornea thins and bulges into a cone shape, causing distorted vision. 

I have this condition and it has always been hard to explain to friends and family what my eyesight was like. Well not anymore!

This script uses OpenCV to generate an image or video that mimics my natural eyesight.
